# What is this?

The CyberDrain Improved Partner Portal is a portal to help manage administration for Microsoft Partners. The current Microsoft partner landscape makes it fairly hard to manage multi tenant situations, with loads of manual work. Microsoft Lighthouse might resolve this in the future but development of this is lagging far behind development of the current market for Microsoft Partners.

This project is a way to help you with administration, with user management, and deploying your own preferred standards. It's not a replacement for security tools, or a way to cut costs on specific subscriptions. The tool should assist you in removing the gripes with standard partner management and save you several hours per engineer per month.

for more information, we recommend checking out our website [here](https://cipp.app)
